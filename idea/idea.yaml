# idea.yaml — Describe your MVP experiment
#
# Fill in every field below. Claude Code reads this file to decide what to build.
# See idea/idea.example.yaml for a complete worked example.
#
# HOW TO FILL THIS IN:
# 1. Replace every "TODO" value with your actual content
# 2. Keep the YAML structure as-is — don't rename keys or change indentation
# 3. When you're done, open Claude Code and run: /bootstrap

# --- Identity ---
name: TODO                  # Lowercase slug, hyphens only (e.g., "quick-bill"). Used in analytics.
title: TODO                 # Human-readable title (e.g., "QuickBill — Fast Invoicing for Freelancers")
owner: TODO                 # Your name or handle (e.g., "sarah"). Used in analytics.
template_repo: magpiexyz-lab/mvp-template  # GitHub repo where retro feedback is filed

# --- Problem & Solution ---
problem: |
  TODO: Describe the pain point in 1-3 sentences.
  Who has this problem? How do they cope today?

solution: |
  TODO: Describe your proposed solution in 1-3 sentences.
  What does the user get that they don't have today?

target_user: "TODO: Be specific (e.g., freelance designers billing <5 clients/month)"

distribution: |
  TODO: How will you get this in front of target users?
  e.g., Post in r/freelance, Indie Hackers, LinkedIn outreach

# --- Pages ---
# List every page in the app. Claude will create exactly these pages, no more.
# "landing" is required — it's your home page.
# The "name" becomes the URL route (e.g., name: dashboard → /dashboard, name: invoice-create → /invoice-create).
# "landing" is special — it maps to / (the root page).
pages:
  - name: landing
    purpose: "TODO: What does the landing page do? (e.g., Explain value prop, collect signups)"
  # Add more pages below. Examples:
  # - name: dashboard
  #   purpose: Show main app view after login
  # - name: settings
  #   purpose: Account and billing settings

# --- Features ---
# List up to ~5 features. Each is a short description of one capability.
features:
  - TODO — First feature
  # - Second feature
  # - Third feature

# --- Success Metric ---
primary_metric: "TODO: What single metric determines if this experiment succeeds?"
target_value: "TODO: What number means success? (e.g., 50 signups, 10 paid users, $500 MRR)"
measurement_window: "TODO: How long to run? (e.g., 2 weeks, 30 days)"

# --- Stack ---
# Each value maps to a stack file at .claude/stacks/<category>/<value>.md
# To use a different technology, change the value and ensure the stack file exists.
# If no stack file exists, Claude will use its knowledge of that technology.
# Defaults below work for most experiments. Only change if you have a specific reason.
stack:
  framework: nextjs        # Web framework — leave default
  hosting: vercel           # Where the app is deployed — leave default
  database: supabase        # Database and backend — leave default
  auth: supabase            # Login/signup system — leave default
  analytics: posthog        # Usage tracking — leave default
  ui: shadcn                # UI component library — leave default
  # payment: stripe         # Uncomment if your experiment involves payments
  testing: playwright      # Page-load smoke tests — created by bootstrap
