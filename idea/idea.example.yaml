title: QuickBill — Dead-Simple Invoicing for Freelancers
owner: sarah
template_repo: acme/experiment-template  # GitHub repo where retro feedback is filed

# --- Problem & Solution ---
problem: |
  Freelancers billing fewer than 5 clients per month waste 2-3 hours on invoicing.
  They bounce between spreadsheets, PDF generators, and manual payment follow-ups.
  Existing tools (FreshBooks, QuickBooks) are overkill and expensive for their needs.

solution: |
  A single-page invoicing tool where freelancers create an invoice in under 60 seconds,
  send a payment link to clients, and get notified when paid. No accounting features,
  no complexity — just create, send, get paid.

target_user: Freelance designers and developers billing 1-5 clients per month

distribution: |
  Post launch in r/freelance, r/webdev, Indie Hackers.
  LinkedIn posts targeting freelancer communities.
