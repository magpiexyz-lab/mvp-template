  name: test-auth-only
  title: AuthOnly — App with Supabase Auth but No Supabase Database
  owner: tester
  template_repo: acme/experiment-template

  problem: |
    Users want a simple authenticated app that stores data in a third-party API
    rather than a traditional database.

  solution: |
    A lightweight app with Supabase Auth for login but no Supabase database — data
    is fetched from an external API using the authenticated user's token.
