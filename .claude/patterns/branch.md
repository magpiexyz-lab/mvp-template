# Branch Setup Procedure

Run this procedure at the start of every code-writing skill, before making any changes.

The skill that invokes this procedure provides two inputs:
- **branch_prefix**: the prefix for the branch name (e.g., `feat`, `change`, `fix`)
- **branch_name**: the full branch name to create (e.g., `feat/bootstrap`, `change/fix-signup-button`)

## Prerequisites

Verify all of these before proceeding. If any check fails, stop and report the error.

1. **Git repository**: run `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If it fails: stop and tell the user: "Not a git repository. Either clone an existing repo (`git clone <url>`) or initialize a new one (`git init && git remote add origin <url>`)."

2. **Not detached HEAD**: run `git symbolic-ref HEAD`. If it fails: stop and tell the user: "HEAD is detached. Run `git checkout main` to switch to a branch."

3. **Origin remote exists**: run `git remote get-url origin`. If it fails: stop and tell the user: "No 'origin' remote found. Run `git remote add origin <repo-url>` to set one up."

4. **GitHub CLI authenticated**: run `gh auth status`. If it fails: stop and tell the user: "GitHub CLI is not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate."

## Uncommitted Changes Check

Run `git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet`. If either fails (there are uncommitted changes): stop and tell the user: "You have uncommitted changes. Please commit or stash them first." Show `git status --short` output.

## Switch to Default Branch and Pull Latest

1. Detect the default branch: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'`. If empty, assume `main` and warn: "Could not detect default branch — assuming 'main'. Run `git remote set-head origin --auto` to fix." Then verify the assumed branch exists: `git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main`. If it fails, stop and tell the user: "Default branch detection failed and `main` does not exist. Run `git remote set-head origin --auto` to configure the default branch, then retry."

2. If the current branch (from `git branch --show-current`) is not the default branch, run `git checkout <default-branch>`.

3. Pull latest: run `git pull --ff-only`. If that fails, try `git pull --rebase`. If rebase also fails, run `git rebase --abort` and stop: "Could not update the default branch. Run `git pull` manually and retry."

## Create Feature Branch

1. Build the branch name from the skill's inputs. The skill provides the full `branch_name`.

2. **Slugify** (if the skill passes a description instead of a fixed name): convert to lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens, remove leading/trailing hyphens, truncate to 40 characters.

3. **Handle collisions**: if a branch with that name already exists (`git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/<branch_name>`), append `-2`. If that also exists, try `-3`, and so on.

4. Create and switch to the branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`

After this procedure completes, the skill is on a clean feature branch based on the latest default branch. Proceed with the skill's implementation steps.
